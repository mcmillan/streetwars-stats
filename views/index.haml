          the mustache mainframe&trade; (streetwars.net) is great, but it doesn't
          actually provide you a way of seeing who's the most dangerous player/team.
        %p
          this site lists everyone in streetwars ordered by their
          %em lethality
          \- the amount of kills they've made divided by the number of people in
          their team. for example, a team with 4 people but only 1 kill is
          significantly less lethal than a solo player with 1 kill. if two teams
          have the same lethality, the bigger team will appear higher as they have
          more resource to increase their killing power. science, bitches!
